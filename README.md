// generate meta data
generate mete data for layout
applicable for child routes or root node meta data same for all the pages.

Dynamic roiting metadata can be generated by the pages.
eg product metadata for the product id  

// useRouter() hook 
to const router=useRouter()
router.push("/path") to navigate to the path
.replace     just like replace in link component 
.back()     recent page
.forward()    to next page

//template do not preserve the state i.e changes every time  a component mounts and changed
but in the  layout state is preserved when any child  component is mounted or rendered 

// possible to have both or we can have either of them

in case of the both we can say that layout then template is rendered as its child.

// special files we have enconutered page.tsx , layout.tsx , template.tsx , not-found.text
// loading.tsx  automatically bound page children in react suspense boundary 
 also user and interact with other layouts or components while loading

// error.tsx for error handling
